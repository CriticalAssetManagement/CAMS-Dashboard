# CAMS-Dashboard
This repo relates to the CAMS (Critical Asset Management System) project UI.

CAMS is an open-source project dedicated to helping nations, communities, cities, and people become disaster resilient. We want to enable people to plan for disasters so they can rebuild faster and save lives.

Develop and deliver a mobile and desktop application that users can securely access to learn more about their critical assets and the potential failure chains associated with each.

## Getting started

### Step 1 - TerminusDB

TerminusDB is used as our database back-end to store the critical assets.

- Sign into TerminusDB https://terminusdb.com/

- Create a new Data Product by the ID ```CAMSDemo``` by clicking "New Data Product" in the upper right corner of the dashboard.

- Add the the CAMS schema from [https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/CAMS-Dashboard/blob/main/CAMSSchema.JSON](https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/CAMS-Dashboard/blob/main/CAMSSchema.json) by doing the following:
  - Open the schema by clicking on the upper link and copy the entire schema in your clipboard
  - Click on the added data product in the sidebar (called CAMSDemo in this README example)
  - Click on the bubbly icon on the sidebar on the left (the second entry in the three icons)
  - Click on the JSON View tab
  - Click the edit button
  - Paste the entire schema, overwrite the default schema and save it

### Step 2 - Clone CAMS Dashboard repo ```CAMS-Dashboard```

- Clone https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/CAMS-Dashboard locally
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/CriticalAssetManagement/CAMS-Dashboard.git
  cd CAMS-Dashboard
  ```

### Step 3: Set up ENV for TerminusX

- Create an ```.env``` file in the CAMS-Dashboard directory and include the below variables.

    ```
    let team = process.env.MY_TEAM                  // your team
    let token = process.env.MY_TOKEN                // your personal token
    let user = process.env.MY_USER                  // your email account used for signing into TerminusX
    let server = process.env.TERMINUSDB_SERVER      // TerminusX URL https://dashboard.terminusdb.com/
    ```

    Refer https://terminusdb.com/docs/index/terminusx/quick-start/get-api-key on how to get your team and token information
    from TerminusX.

### Step 4 - Run development environment (NodeJS locally)

Run inside the CAMS-dashboard directory:
- `npm install`


- Run locally `npm run start`

### Step 4 - Run development environment (docker-compose)
